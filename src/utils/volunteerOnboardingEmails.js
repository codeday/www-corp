Thank you for your interest in volunteering for CodeDay!

We currently have a need for the following positions:
* Mentor (recommended for current/former software engineers or product managers)
Provide mentorship once a week for 10-12 weeks as students create a project or make their first pull requests to popular open-source software. This program is very structured and does not require much prep-work.


* Career Advisor (recommended for current/former HR or hiring managers)
Provide resume feedback or host practice interviews with a few students each month.


Can you please schedule a 15-min onboarding call using the following link: https://www.codeday.org/m/codeday-labs/onboarding


If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!


Best,
