Thank you for volunteering for CodeDay! We currently have these open roles:

* Mentor (for current/former SWEs or PMs)
Provide once-a-week mentorship for 2-3 months as students create a project or contribute to open-source software. This program is very structured and does not require much preparation on your part.

* Career Advisor (for current/former HR or hiring managers)
Provide resume feedback, or host practice interviews, for a few students each month.

If interested, please schedule a 15 minute onboarding call via this link: https://codeday.org/m/codeday-labs/onboarding

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out at anytime!

Best,
Charlie Liu (he/him)
